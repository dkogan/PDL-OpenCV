This is an early prototype of PDL bindings to OpenCV. All bindings are
auto-generated from OpenCV headers. Any OpenCV function that doesn't take as its
arguments ONLY matrices or scalars is not yet bound. Since everything is
auto-generated, all piddles have to have the correct sizes before calling the
OpenCV routines. THIS INCLUDES OUTPUTS. This requirement makes any useful PDL
threading impossible. Further, at this point ALL arguments must be
supplied. PDL::null can be used for empty piddles.


So far this has ONLY been tested on amd64 machines running Debian
GNU/Linux. This is significant because the parsed OpenCV headers came from the
Debian libcv-dev package.
